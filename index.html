      <h1>Hi, I&lsquo;m Brad</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">And here&lsquo;s some things about me&hellip;</p>

      <section>
        <p>
          <span class="newthought">I love creating things.</span> Most days, I&lsquo;m <a href="https://github.com/bfolkens">writing software</a> or developing products <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradfolkens/">through my companies</a> or for my clients.
        I also deeply enjoy <a href="https://soundcloud.com/brad-folkens">composing music</a>, <a href="https://https://500px.com/bfolkens">making photos</a>, and reading up on typography, graphic design, or other crafts.
          There&lsquo;s something about seeing an idea come to life that&lsquo;s infinitely inspiring to me. Indeed, if there was a way for me to fully live in the present, it would be in the immediacy of creativity.

        <div class="epigraph">
          <blockquote>
            <p>For the present is the point at time at which time touches eternity. Of the present moment, and of it only, humans have an experience analogous to the experience which our Enemy has of reality as a whole; in it alone freedom and actuality are offered them.</p>

          I write code with <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> and keep it organized and versioned with <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a>.
          <label for="mn-linus" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="mn-linus" class="margin-toggle"/>
          <span class="marginnote">
            Linus, thank you so very much that I never have to use SVN or CVS ever again. &#x1F64F;
          </span>
          I&lsquo;ve completely fallen in love with functional programming (for application development tasks), where I prefer <a href="https://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> for backend and server-side application development. Before this, I used <a href="https://rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> for over a decade (since 0.9.1) as my backend framework of choice.  I also <a href="https://contributors.rubyonrails.org/contributors/bradford-folkens/commits">contributed a bit</a> to Rails core. Though I&lsquo;ve moved on to other tools for larger projects, I still choose <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> for quick-n-dirty scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&lsquo;ve been dabbling around with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> more and more these days for when I need to reach for a systems-level programming language, quickly replacing my previous choice of C/C++.  <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> is still my &ldquo;I need to do something data-science related,&rdquo; usually with <a href="https://pytorch.org">PyTorch</a> as a framework for making the numbers happen. I&lsquo;ve used TensorFlow too, but I find myself gravitating more towards the former when I need to reach for a framework. Long ago, I got my start with Perl, PHP, and Java &ndash; I think I&lsquo;m allergic to Java.
        </p>
        <p>
          Database engineering &amp; design is something with which I&lsquo;m intimately familiar. I got my stripes with Oracle 7-10g, then quickly moved to MySQL, MariaDB, and finally arrived in the promised land of <a href="https://postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>.
          I tried the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL">NoSQL</a> thing (like everyone else)<label for="sn-web-scale" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-web-scale" class="margin-toggle"/>, including MongoDB (for the right reasons), and still ended up back in RDMS-land.
          <span class="sidenote">
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">Mongo DB Is Web Scale</a>
          </span>
          Yes, I still think NoSQL is great if you genuinely need a document store (I did, once, when I built a search engine), though that decision should be <em>very</em> carefully weighed.

          I&lsquo;ve never considered myself a &ldquo;front-end&rdquo; specialist, yet I&lsquo;ve gained considerable experience with JavaScript (Vanilla, ES6, etc.), including the great <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a> visualization library. I&lsquo;ve played around with <a href="https://elm-lang.org">Elm</a> a bit, but with the latest <a href="https://www.phoenixframework.org">Phoenix</a> features (<a href="https://shift.infinite.red/phoenixs-liveview-client-side-elixir-at-last-2280716ae791">LiveView</a> &#x1F924;) I wonder if I&lsquo;ll ever need to reach for a front-end framework in the capacity I once did.
        </p>

          I tend to choose <a href="https://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a> these days for deployment and orchestration.  However, I spent quite some time navigating the AWS ecosystem and its various flavors of deployment and server/server-less tools. When it comes to consistency between testing and deployment environments, and ease of deployment in general, <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a> and other containerization technology is my go-to.
